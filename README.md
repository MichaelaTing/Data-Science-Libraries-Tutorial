# Introduction

Data science is a rapidly growing field that leverages statistical and computational techniques to extract insights from data. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science, thanks to its powerful libraries. This repository focuses on three of the most essential libraries:

* **NumPy** : A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
* **Pandas** : A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib** : A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

We hope you find it useful for learning and improving your data science skills.
